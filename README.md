## 🚀 Inspiration  
Food discovery and meal planning can be time-consuming and impersonal. We aimed to solve this by creating an interactive, AI-driven chatbot that provides tailored meal suggestions based on user preferences, overcoming language barriers, and making food exploration accessible for everyone.  

## 🧠 What it does  
Our chatbot offers:  
- Voice-enabled, multilingual interactions to understand user queries.  
- Personalized food recommendations based on preferences and dietary requirements.  
- Memory retention for adaptive suggestions in future interactions.  
- Intuitive UI with a virtual assistant for seamless, natural communication.  

## ⚙ How we built it  
- Frontend: Interactive UI developed using streamlit and voice input in various Indian languages 
- Backend: Python-based RAG engine for data mapping and recommendation generation.  
- AI/ML: Locally trained models for keyword extraction, language processing, and reinforced learning.  
- Data Integration: The out given by the ML model is used as an anchor for the basis of search in a vector database where with various interaction a cluster is found and the top 5 matches are shown.  
- Speech-to-Text: Integrated APIs for multilingual voice input conversion.  

## 💡 Challenges we ran into  
- Handling multilingual input: Ensuring accurate understanding of diverse languages.  
- Efficient keyword mapping: Optimizing the vector-embedded map for fast and accurate results.  
- UI design: Creating a responsive and engaging virtual assistant interface.  
We tackled these challenges through extensive testing, optimization, and leveraging advanced AI frameworks.  

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Achieved 55% mapping accuracy for personalized recommendations.  
- Implemented real-time processing with an average response time of 2 seconds.
